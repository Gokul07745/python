Cardiac Anomaly Detection Using Variational Autoencoders

This project focuses on leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to detect cardiac anomalies. The model is trained to learn normal cardiac patterns and identifies deviations that may indicate potential anomalies.

Key Highlights
- Utilizes VAEs for unsupervised anomaly detection.
- Models normal cardiac activity and flags outliers.
- Aims to improve early detection of cardiac conditions.
